# 👋 Hi, I’m Lauryn Zhai! 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! It's great to meet you virtually 😊

👀 I’m passionate about Business Analytics and Data-Driven Strategy.  
With a strong foundation in **data analysis, financial modeling, predictive analytics, and strategic planning**, I thrive on transforming complex data into actionable business insights.

💼 I’m currently a **Corporate Planning Analyst** at **Honda Aircraft Company**, where I contribute to strategic decision-making and operational efficiency through data and analytics.

🎓 I hold a **Master of Science in Business Analytics** from **Wake Forest University School of Business** (Class of 2024), and a **Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration** from the **University of California, Irvine**.

🌱 I’m always looking to grow and collaborate—especially in areas related to **machine learning**, **data visualization**, and **customer strategy**. Let's connect and share ideas!

📫 Feel free to reach out to chat about analytics, strategy, or just to say hi!  
Excited to be part of the data-driven community here on GitHub. Let’s innovate together!
